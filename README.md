Old cgi bash script website I hacked together with beginners knowledge of bash scripting.  Replaced with www.silicatewastes.com after I learned Python.

I don't know if this project is worth looking at.  I didn't know bash scripting, I had to google every little thing I did and cobbled it together as fast as I could.  I didn't even know about get or post requests, apparently I was doing a get request without even knowing it.  I really had no interest in web programming back then and just wanted to get it over with.

There is a sed command in match.cgi, so I guess I'm proud of that.  I have no memory of writing that line.  I've seen entire books about the sed and awk commands.  Maybe someday I'll read one.

You could probably get this to run if you made some directories and stuffed some dxf files in them. The main page was really sinks.cgi but you might find the real sinks.cgi in sinks.bak or something.  I think I cleared out sinks.cgi and replaced it with a link to silicatewastes.com towards the end of its life.
