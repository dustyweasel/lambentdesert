<h2>1) Pegasus / Glacier Bay</h2>
<p>
Pegasus and Glacier Bay are the same thing these days as far as I can tell.  Check both folders.
</p>
<h2>2) Flush sinks</h2>
<p>
If the sink has to be a flush cut there's a chance you will find a dxf but then maybe we'll make you bring the sink back anyway.  Some of the
sink drawings we have suck and only pass inspection because overhang saves the day.  There's no guarantee that expanding a sink drawn five
years ago by god knows who by 1/4" will match a sink perfectly.  Some .dxf's say flush in the filename and those are probably okay.
</p>
<h2>3) Rectangle, circle, ellipse</h2>
<p>
If you can't find the .dxf and you still don't want to bring the sink back then is it a rectangle, circle, or ellipse?  You could probably just
write down the dimensions.
<br/><br/>
Watch out on elliptical sinks.  One out of 500 isn't really an ellipse. Look:
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Owal_by_Zureks.svg">ellipse example</a>
It's hard to see on that picture but you can usually see it in real life.  On an ellipse the curvature of the sink changes continuously.
Once in a blue moon the sink is actually 4 arcs.  An arc is a piece of a circle where the curvature is constant.  (if you imagine any arc
continuing it will always wrap around and make a circle)  The blue sink on bottom is not an ellipse.  It is made out of the four arcs above.
The top part of that bottom circle, the left part of that left circle, etc.  I can't tell that by looking at the blue sink but in real life
I can tell.  (Or even if I've been wrong I've never guessed that a sink was an ellipse and had the top come back.  If you're pretty sure it's
an ellipse then it is.  Just watch out for the obvious ones.  We never actually cut ellipses, anyway, the machines don't understand them.
Whenever you draw an ellipse in CAD the software approximates the shape using arcs just like that picture except it uses more than four arcs.)
<br/><br/>
The red sink is an ellipse.  You might remember in high school we used to draw them by sticking two pins in a board and tying a string to
them with slack.  Sort of like this only without the math:
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Ellipse_Properties_of_Directrix_and_String_Construction.svg/884px-Ellipse_Properties_of_Directrix_and_String_Construction.svg.png">Ellipse with a string</a>
The curvature changes continuously.  All we need for those is the two dimensions and tell us whether to shrink for overhang or not.
<!--<br/><br/>
Or just bring the sink back.  It's probably safer.  Besides, if you just give us a drawing then I'm probably not gonna add it to the sink library because I don't trust you,
I'll probably just use it for that one job.-->
</p>
<!--<h2>FUN FACTS:</h2>
<p>
Pretty much all the sinks we use are stored as dxf's in the waterjet folders.  The waterjet uses programs saved as .ord files which are
generated in FlowPath.  We open the .dxf's in FlowPath and turn them into .ord's.  When drawing for the CNC or sawjet we just import those
dxf's from the waterjet folder.
<br/><br/>
.dwg files are AutoCAD files.  They're completely useless.
<br/><br/>
.ard and .asd files are AlphaCAM files.  AlphaCAM is for programming the cnc's and sawjet.  I actually have a lot of sinks saved in this
format.
