<p>
I made tombstones yesterday for people who couldn't afford the professional kind.  Usually people just want them for pets so I was kind of skeptical about the idea
but I guess they look a lot better than I thought they would:<br/>

<br/><br/>
The other times they always picked out caesarstone but this time for some reason they wanted green butterfly.  Whatever.  You can see how it chipped too much the second time I tried.
And then it chipped too much the third time I tried.  Also it chipped too much the first time I tried but that part's hidden behind the template board in the foreground.
<br/><br/>
The fouth time I guess I got it right.  I know I was less than 0.02" below the face of the rock that time with a worn out ball end tool.  I let it run at 10" a minute and I went and collapsed on a table for like an hour
or something because I had a throbbing headache.  I really have no idea how long it took.
<br/><br/>
Anyway if you're dead and you need a cheap tombstone then email me: <a href="mailto:laconiclizard@lambentdesert.com">laconiclizard@lambentdesert.com</a>
