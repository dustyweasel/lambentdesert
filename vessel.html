Here's a math problem.  You ever seen one of these vessel sinks?  They mostly sit on top of the countertop.  Here's my drawing:<br/>

If you think my picture sucks then do a google image seach for vessel sinks and you'll see what I'm talking about.

Sometimes the customer wants it sunk a certain distance below the surface of the countertop.  That's where this real-life math problem comes from.  Here's the same drawing only looking at it from the bottom side:<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/vessel2.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>

Try to imagine a gap there between the sink and the rock, I didn't put too much time into my drawing.  We're not cutting a sloped hole that hugs the bottom of the sink.  We're cutting the hole straight up and down so it will only touch the sink on the face side and there will be a gap on the bottom side.

I've seen guys cutting a small hole by hand with a side grinder, putting the sink in it, measuring, taking the sink out, making the hole bigger, putting the sink back in, etc.  (This is embarassingly stupid because it means the cnc guys didn't know how to do it so hand fab had to cut it.  We're about to make a math problem out of this and solve it with pencil and paper.  If a cnc guy can't do the math you'd think he could at least draw it on CAD and take a measurement.  One thing I've noticed about this industry is nobody can think outside (or inside) the box.)
<br/><br/>
Alright, so what if you just want to know the diameter of the hole you have to cut before you start so you can just cut the hole once and be done?  And pretend you have no access to CAD.  The first thing you need to note about this sink is that it's shaped as if it were a section of a sphere.  It's not half a sphere.  It's less than half a sphere.  That's your most important clue.
<br/><br/>
Okay.  You put a tape measure on it and it's 29.076 units wide.  It's 11.306 units tall.  And the customer wants it sunk 2.838 units below the surface of the countertop.  What diameter hole do you need to cut?  Here's a drawing:<br/>

First person who solves this gets an honorary mention on this page.  You have to show me the math, though, or I'll assume you used CAD and cheated.
