<h1><a href="index.html"><img class="wesnoth"src="mainimages/skirmisher.png" alt="" /></a>AlphaCAM vs. Tetris:</h1>
<p>
This is sort of a continuation of <a href="penny.html">the ten penny experiment.</a>
<br/><br/>
Check out #21 from this page: <a href="https://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/linsqu/">that math guy.</a>
<br/><br/>
Let's see how AlphaCAM's nesting handles that one:<br/>

<br/><br/>
Not bad.  But, the question on everyone's mind now is... how well does AlphaCAM play tetris?  I drew up the pieces below and
fit them onto a 10x20 tetris board.  If you don't believe me then download it below.  Then I let AlphaCAM's nesting try and
it failed miserably:

<br/><br/>
The moral of the story is if you think nesting is always going to use the least possible material then you are wrong.
I have a couple jobs around here somewhere where AlphaCAM thought it needed ten slabs but we fit it on eight.  I'll dig one up
and post it here sooner or later.<br/>
<br/>
Actually I tried again but this time I gave it 120 seconds to think and it came up with the one on the right:<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/tetris2.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
You can see how
it's sticking with patterns it likes for each shape but that's not how to win in the long run.  Plus it still sucked just as
bad, it didn't fit two pieces again.  I wonder how high you can increase
the time per sheet option?  What if I let it run all weekend?  Hold on... nope.  It maxes out at 9999.  Okay I'll be back
Monday to see how it did.

Update 5/14/18:

<p>
Well, with 9,999 seconds it fit all of them but one piece so it did a little better.  I don't know if it used all 9,999 seconds.  I think it probably reached
the end of whatever algorithm it uses before then but who knows.  Again, you can see how obsessed it is with reusing the same pattern with each shape:
