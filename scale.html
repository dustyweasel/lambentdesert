<p>
Have you ever downloaded a Blanco sink and it was hundreds of inches wide?<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale1.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
What's going on?  The answer is Blanco is a German manufacturer and in
backwards nations like Germany they use an archaic system of measurement called the "metric" system.  The metric system was designed by Napoleon in 1799
and it was such a catastrophe that he lost the war and was banished to the island of St. Helena for his crimes.
<br/><br/>
Anyway, you might have figured out that you can still use those drawings, all you have to do is convert them to inches.  See, that drawing is supposed to be 774.7
millimeters wide.  There's 25.4 millimeters in one inch.  So simply scale the drawing by 1/25.4 for both x and y.
Like so:<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale2.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
And then you get this:<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale3.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
Much better.  Now I don't remember how Blanco draws sinks.  That might be flush, it might be reveal.  Whatever.  Let's just pretend it's flush.  You put your
tape measure on the sink and it's exactly 30 1/2" wide.  You need to shrink it for overhang.  So what do you do?  You offset it in by 1/4".
<br/><br/>
No sweat.  But here's something maybe you never really thought about.  When you scaled it, you shrank it.  When you offset it, you shrank it.  What's the difference?
Are scaling and offsetting the same thing?  If you know what you're doing can you use them interchangeably?
<br/><br/>
No, you dumbass.  Don't feel bad, though.  I sort of assumed they
were the same thing for a long time before I sat down and thought about it.  In fact, when I was being trained in Minnesota I asked the instructors if scaling and offsetting
were interchangeable and after stuttering for a couple seconds they told me yes, because they didn't know the answer.
<br/><br/>
The thing that really made me stop and realize I hadn't thought it through was imagine zooming in and out.  If you have a circle 10" in diameter and you offset it 1"
in then you have an 8" diameter circle.  It's kind of the same as if you zoomed out or moved a few feet further away from the circle.  It's also the same as if you
scaled the circle by 80%.  So on a circle scaling and offsetting are interchangeable.<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale4.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
So why aren't they interchangealbe on sinks?  Why aren't they interchangeable on
anything more complicated than one arc or one line?
<br/><br/>
Well, what if you offset that 10" diameter circle 5" in?  You get a 0" diameter circle.  What if you offset it 6" in?  You get a 0" diameter circle.  You get the idea.
Okay, so in the granite industry we say things like "one inch radius" when we're talking about a corner on a top.  I don't know what geometry professors would say
about our lingo but what that means is that the arc on that corner is part of a 1" radius circle.  (2" diameter circle)  The curvature of an arc does not change.  If
you continue it, you don't get a spiral.  If you continue it, you get a circle.  So any corner we make with a "one inch radius" is an arc that if continued will make
a 1" radius circle.<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale5.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
Okay, so what if we have a sink with a little 1/8" radius corner and we offset it in 1/4" for overhang?  We get a 0" radius corner.  Okay now this is where I realized
I had never thought about this for more than half a minute.  Once you offset something in and a radius disappears you lose information.  I mean if you have a rectangle
with 1" radius corners and you offset it in 1/2", you can offset it back out 1/2" and get back to what you started with.  But if you offset it 2" in and offset it back
out 2" the radii do not magically come back.  They're gone.<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale6.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
So as you can see, offsetting is not analogous (ain't the same) to zooming.  If you were zooming, no matter how far you move from that rectangle, if you have eagle vision, there's always
going to be smaller and smaller radii on the corners.  They won't disappear.  When you move closer they'll come back.  Now scaling, unlike offsetting, IS analagous
to zooming.  Assuming you had a magical computer that could handle all infinity decimals between 0 and 1 then no matter how far you scaled it bigger or smaller no
information would ever be lost and you could always zoom back to where you started.
<br/><br/>
So what's important to note here is that when you offset, you are WARPING your drawing.  Look at our blanco sink after we offset it out 5":<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale7.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
Ahhh!  It's an abomination!  See, that's not the same as zooming.  If you used offsetting to convert your sink from millimeters to inches (bad idea) you'd warp it beyond recognition.
So then, omg, whenever we offset in for overhang we've been warping them this whole time!
We've been doing it wrong!  Right!?
<br/><br/>
Wrong.  When you shrink for overhang you WANT to warp it.  You want every line and arc to be exactly 1/4" away from the wall of the sink.  Your cutout should not be
scaled.  Let's look at the difference between the drawing offset in for 1/4" overhang vs. one that we scale.  Okay, if the flush drawing is 30 1/2" wide and we offset in for
1/4" overhang then the new drawing will be 30" wide.  So if we want to do the same thing with scaling we divide 30 by 30.5 and get 0.9836 so that's what we want to scale
by but something doesn't look right:<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale8.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
Oh, it's because I scaled by 0.9836 for x AND y.  I want to scale by 0.9742
for y because that's 18.846/19.346.  Right?  So let's try that:<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale9.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
Hey that looks right!  Right?  Well, no.  Check it out:<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale10.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
The lines look right, there's 1/4" in between them.  The big arc on the top left seems sort of correct.  But look at the big arc on the top right.  We lost about 1/16" of
overhang.  And look at the bottom left corner.  You can see that doesn't look right at all.  In this case the only parts that come out "correct" were the three
lines; the left, the right, and the bottom.  All the arcs are wrong.  Even the big one on the top left.  In fact, any lines that weren't lying on the outer edge
of the box we used for calculating scaling would have been wrong, too.  Check out this sink, I scaled it using the same incorrect technique I used on the blanco sink:<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale11.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
It already looks wrong from a distance.  Let's look closer.<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale12.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
So you can see the four lines on the outer box I used to calculate my x and y scale are pretty much correct.  But look at the horizontal line on the top right.  I lost
1/16" of overhang there.  And then look at the little vertical line.  That's completely wrong.<br/><br/>
The way I see it, scaling and offsetting are interchangeable in a somewhat complicated way.  Look at the blanco sink where I offset it out 5":<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/scale13.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
The lines stay the same length.  They're simply moved out 5".  (Note: They join to arcs on both sides.  If they joined to other lines then they would have grown.  Think about it.)
In this case they're all orthogonal (vertical or horizontal) so they're all moved either 5" up, down, left,
or right.  Now look at the arcs.  They keep the same center.  They just have 5 added to their radii.  Imagine continuing the purple or green arcs until they made a
circle.  See how they're cocentric?  They have the same center.  The green circle goes perfectly around the purple circle on the top one and the purple circle goes
perfectly around the green circle on the bottom left.<br/><br/>
So if we were mentally ill and we wanted to use scaling instead of offsetting then we would have to break the drawing up
into lines and arcs.  (assuming our drawing consists of nothing but lines and arcs)  So you can see those two arcs above would have to be scaled by 5.85/0.85 and
0.75/5.75, etc.  You get the idea.  (Wait.  So on a .85" radius you would add 5 to get 5.85.  Divide 5.85 by 0.85 to get 6.882.  That's what you scale by.  So multiply
0.85 by 6.882 to get 5.85.  Wow, that got stupid real fast.)<br/><br/>
To sum up all this nonsense with one word, I would say, "ratios".  When you offset, every line or arc is moved out or in by a set number.  If you offset out by 5 then all the lines move out by 5 and the arcs increase
in radius by 5.  No part of your drawing keeps its size relative to the rest of the drawing the same, everything is thrown out of whack.  When we offset 1/4" in for overhang it LOOKS like we just made a smaller
version of the sink but that's only because 1/4" isn't enough to see that it's warped.  A drawing that is offset in 1/4" for overhang is warped and it's supposed to be warped.
<br/><br/>
Now when you scale, all the ratios stay in tact.  Imagine a sink 30" wide and 10" tall.  Suppose you scale x and y by 0.5.  Now it's 15" wide and 5" tall.  30/10=3.  15/5=3.  The ratios stay in tact.  Every arc
and line is going to be the same size relative to the rest of the drawing as it was before you scaled it.  It's not warped.  See the first few pics where I scaled it by 1/25.4, it still looks the same.
When you scale, a shrunk sink close up
will look identical to an expanded sink from far away.
<br/><br/>
So whatever.  When you're altering the drawing for overhang or if you're drawing laminates then you want to use offset.  You want the new drawing to be warped.  You want it to follow the contour.  (Or if you hate yourself
you can use scaling and break it up into parts like I just said.)  But if you have a drawing from Europe or some other backwards land then you want to use scaling to get it back to inches,
the way God intended.  Understand?  Me, neither.<br/><br/>
