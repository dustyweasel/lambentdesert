Compress your sink files to a zip folder and email them to me: <a href="mailto:laconiclizard@protonmail.com">laconiclizard@protonmail.com<br/><br/></a> I don't care if I already have some of them.  Duplicates are fine, just
send everything.
If email isn't working let me know and I'll set up an ftp account for you.  If you don't get a thx email from me then that means I never got it.
<br/><br/>
lambentdesert.com needs more sinks.  more!  MORE!  Do you want to live in a world where templaters never have to bring a sink back to the shop and risk cracking it during transit?
Do you want to live in a world where no one in the shop has to look through all the boxes for the right sink, pull it out, draw it, and then figure out how to fit it back in the
box with all the god forsaken styrofoam and packaging?  Do you want to live in a world where the guys that load the trucks for install never run around in circles for half an hour trying to
figure out where the sink is?
<br/><br/>
There's a better way!  Compress every sink you have drawn to a zip file and email it to me!
I'll make them all downloadable and every sink in the world will be available here at the click of a button.  Every donator gets their own page and logo from
<a href="wesnoth.html">The Battle for Wesnoth</a>.  Tell me if you want to get credit for your donation or remain anonymous donor X.<br/><br/>
No one will have to search through every folder because the <a href="search.cgi?search=040">search bar</a> at the top of <a href="sinks.cgi">sinks.cgi</a> will scan every folder and find every copy of what you're looking for.
You'll know which stash you're downloading from so you'll know if it's one you want to double check or not as you get to trust certain folders.
<br/><br/>
I have another massive stash of sinks, I don't know where they came from, but if I get 10 donations I'll make those
downloadable too.
<br/><br/>
I  might put ads on my site some day but I'll try to keep the site fast and not as obnoxious as every other webpage on the internet.  Anyway if that makes you
feel like I'm making money off your back then don't send me files.  (But come on, send me files.  I get like 60 vistitors a day. I think I'd be lucky to make $20 a
month at this rate.)
<br/><br/>
Maybe someday I'll make it so people can sign in and rate drawings.  Like 5 stars or zero stars.  But I'm probably too lazy.
<br/><br/>
Also I'm going to make some AlphaCAM tutorials.  Would anyone be interested in that?
