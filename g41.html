<p>
Our tools are setup up with G41/42 on Tool Center, whatever that means:<br/>

Well, I know it means the final depth and the tool diameter and all that in AlphaCAM matters, then the values at the CNC will augment whatever
AlphaCAM says.  Basically the tool diameter is supposed to be in the program and you're just supposed to tweak it at the CNC with small values.
I think on The Park Industries I used to run the tools were all set up with Machine Comp (G41/42) in which case the machine completely ignored
AlphaCAM and you had to put the tool diameter in at the CNC.  Not sure if I remember that right but I think you could put a diameter of two miles
in AlphaCAM and it would make no difference.
<br/><br/>
So whatever, this guide is only for G41/42 on Tool Center where both the values stored in AlphaCAM and in the CNC are used.
