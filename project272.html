<h2>PLATFORM GAME:</h2>
<p>
You might need this?  Back in the day you needed it for demo1:<br/>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555" target="_blank" >http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555</a><br/><br/>
If I were you I would download 1st demo or Demo 2.5<br/>
1st demo: <a href="maindownloads/Release.zip" target="_blank" >Release.zip</a><br/>
2st demo: <a href="maindownloads/demo2.zip" target="_blank" >demo2.zip</a><br/>
Demo 2.5: <a href="maindownloads/demo2_5b.zip" target="_blank" >demo2_5b.zip</a><br/>
Editor 2.5: <a href="maindownloads/edit2_5b.zip" target="_blank" >edit2_5b.zip</a><br/><br/>
REMEMBER:<br/>
alt-q to exit!<br/>
Also use alt, ctrl, and the arrow keys to move around, run, and attack!<br/>
In demo1 the rats cannot be killed.  I hadn't even programmed that yet.<br/>
The editor is fun to play with but it's not well designed.  I used to have a webpage explaining it but who cares.<br/>
Demo 2.5 is technically a completed little game but there isn't much to it.  Just go find the dragon and kill him.<br/>
The sprites for the main character in demo1 are stolen from A Link to the Past!<br/>
Everything else is drawn by me except for that windmill!<br/>
I did all the sound effects in demo2.5!<br/>
I called myself icecubeflower back then!  That's my old logo up there.<br/>
Some kid on the internet did all the music for me!<br/><br/>
This is a project I worked on in my freetime years ago.  I was using Slackware Linux back then and I mostly used KDevelop, SDL, and
some other stuff.  These windows versions
were hacked together later.  It was mostly going to be a zelda-like platform game except I didn't want to use tiles.  I wanted to be able to
draw the world freehand and then simply scan it to give the whole game a pencil and notebook paper feel.  You can even see the notebook paper
on the first demo's beginning animation.  Then I started experimenting and you can see a 3D space title menu on demo 2.5.  Also note that I
can't draw.  If anyone with artistic talent did the artwork the demos would look a lot better.<br/><br/>
I really didn't know anything when I started so I had to learn and hack away at it at the same time.  Basically when I started I didn't even
know what I didn't know.  Now I know I need to remake the editor using the QT library or something.<br/><br/>
