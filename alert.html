<h1><a href="search.cgi"><img class="wesnoth"src="mainimages/skirmisher.png" alt="" /></a>HIGH LEVEL ALERT!:</h1>
<h2>Alert! Alert! Alert!</h2>

<p>
People, STOP entering the entire sink name into the search bar.  Just stop it!  STOP!  STOP!  STOP!  AAHHHH!!!! Look:<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/alert.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
Look at the screen above.  Read from the bottom up.  First he went to the Tuscany folder.  Didn't find what he was looking for.
Then he went to the search bar and entered rvh7250.  Again, he didn't find what he was looking for.  Then he went back to the Tuscany folder.
(Not sure why.  Maybe Tuscany and Ruvati are the same company or something.)  Still couldn't find it.  So then he did a search for RVH7250.
CAPS don't matter!  That's the same search as rvh7250!  Yet again, he didn't find it and he gave up.
<br/><br/>
You know what search DOES find it?  7250!  Look at the screen below!<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/alert2.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
See!?  It's in the Ruvati folder and there's a space between RVH and 7250.
Look, all the search bar does is see if the fragment you typed in is CONTAINED in the full filename.  THERE IS NO SINK FILENAME THAT CONTAINS RVH7250!!!  THE SPACE RUINS YOUR
SEARCH!!  PERIODS, DASHES, UNDERSCORES AND ALL THAT STUFF WILL RUIN YOUR SEARCH!!
DO YOU GET IT!??  ARRGGHHH!!!!!  JUST ENTER 7250!  OR JUST ENTER RVH!  That'll find it!  It will find every file that contains that fragment!  It might
find a few sinks you weren't looking for as well but the list will be short enough!  See that Danze sink in SMG's folder?  I wasn't looking for that.  But that's okay!
It found every sink on THE WHOLE FREAKING WEBSITE that contains 7250.  It works!  Look!  There's the Ruvati sink up top!  AHHH!!!!
<br/><br/>
Look, I'm not a computer programmer.  I barely know any shellscripting, I'm not even beginner level.  If I decide to take the time to study shell scripting and learn
to make a search
bar that can handle whatever kind of input you people want to use, then I won't have any reason to work at a granite factory anymore.  Don't you get it!?  There can
never be a search bar like that because people that know how to do that don't work at granite factories!  It's a paradox!  It can't happen!  It's like
going back in time and murdering your grandfather.  But if you killed your grandfather before you were born then how would you be born to go back in time to kill
your grandfather in the first place!?
<br/><br/>
So seriously.  Just 7250 from now on.
