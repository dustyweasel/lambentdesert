<h1><a href="index.html"><img class="wesnoth"src="mainimages/skirmisher.png" alt="" /></a>MORE NESTING:</h1>

<p>
This is sort of a continuation of <a href="tetris.html">Nesting vs. Tetris.</a><br/><br/>
Watch nesting fail again.  This time it can't figure out that two pieces fit on one slab.  I had one woodlands job but I scanned ahead and found another
woodlands job that gets installed two days later so I tried to merge them.  (It didn't make any difference this time
but in general merging jobs is about the best way to save material.)<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/woodland1.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
I always assume the smaller caesarstone slabs are 119x54 unless another inch or two will make a difference in which case I curse under my breath and go measure the slabs.
So starting out I want to put the 171733 joints close together.  I don't really pay much attention to anything in the shop anymore but from what I gather joints not matching
is a royal pain in the ass so putting joints close together just makes everything easier.<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/woodland2.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
Well, it looks like there's no way I can put the joints on the giant 173087 pieces next to each other.  Let's try nesting.  I know I rag on AlphaCAM's nesting
but the fact is I use it every day; it's a handy tool and sometimes it "thinks" of something I didn't think of.
<br><br/>
No luck.  I can't figure out.  You can see AlphaCAM's attempt on the right two slabs.  It can't figure it out, either.<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/woodland3.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
So it looks like I'm going to have to go with something like the pic below.  Now at this point you might have seen the obvious already but for
some reason I didn't.
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/woodland4.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
But I had that usual nagging in the back of my mind like, maybe the slab is a couple inches bigger.  And you wouldn't believe
how many times one extra inch made all the difference in the world.  So I cursed under my breath and went and measured the slabs.
I got 120 x 56&frac12;.  So I messed with it some more but even with the bigger slabs I ran into the same issues so I let AlphaCAM's nesting try and as you can see
it couldn't figure it out, either.  (I even tried increasing the time per sheet but it made no difference.  In a blink it decided it needed two slabs.)<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/woodland5.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
So I kept staring at.  Really this took me like ten minutes, I must be drunk on Nyquil or something.  But then I was like oh....<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/woodland6.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
See this what all those nights playing Tetris were for.  Plus this is 3/16" bigger all around for the CNC so if they lose 1/8" on the top or bottom then who cares.
One thing to note is if you rotate those pieces differently before you try AlphaCAM's nesting, it can figure it out.<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/woodland7.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
I don't really know what's up with that.  I'm guessing it's because it started with the way I had the #2 piece so the joint was parallel to the bottom of the slab
but the other time I let it try it didn't have the sense to try that rotation.  Who knows.  Like I said, nesting is a handy tool, just don't rely on it.  So after all that
this is the layout I came up with:<br/>
<img class="drain" src="mainimages/woodland8.png" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>
If we were really at the top of our game we'd move that smallest #3 piece to the yellow job to save a half slab, those half slab remnants save the day all the time.
But I've seen too much color match insanity to care anymore.  All the joints are next to each other, it's staying like this.  So now the shop can just throw these slabs
up and rip through them no problem.  No one has to play "match the slabs".
<br/><br/>
But then again I don't know if it's worth doing any of this this because no one will notice.
If some other guy would have put the two big 173087 pieces on separate slabs he would gotten more credit for programming faster and then when the joints didn't match the shop guys
would have gotten blamed instead of him.<br/><br/>
