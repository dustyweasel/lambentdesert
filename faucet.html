<p>
Does anyone know how to drill faucet holes with the half round tool?  Our guy put the half round tool where the core tool was scanned in but it didn't work.  Astonishingly,
I don't think the rock cracked.  Cosentino knows what they're doing.  Who would have thought recycled milk cartons would make for such durable countertops.  Probably it helped that
there was a suction cup directly underneath.
