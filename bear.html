<p>
<!--<img class="drain" src="mainimages/nyquil.jpg" alt="pic1" /><br/><br/>-->
Mr. Grizzly Bear and all his friends met in the middle of the forest.  Winter was coming and everyone was very worried.  &quotWhat will we eat?&quot said Mr. Rabbit.  &quotAll of the grass will die!&quot
<br/><br/>
&quotWhat will we drink?&quot said Mr. Moose.  &quotThe river will freeze!&quot
<br/><br/>
&quotHow will we stay warm?&quot said Mr. Fox.  &quotThe wind will freeze us to the bones!&quot
<br/><br/>
All of these problems made Mr. Grizzly Bear very worried.  So worried that he went back to his cave, layed down, buried his face in his paws, and tried to stop thinking about all the things that bothered him.
He had almost fallen asleep when little Miss Mouse found him and gave him a good scolding.  &quotMr. Grizzly Bear, you can't just go to sleep and ignore your problems.  When you wake up your problems will still
be there and they will be even worse than before!&quot
<br/><br/>
&quotWhatever,&quot said Mr. Grizzly Bear. &quotI don't want to think about any of that.&quot
<br/><br/>
So Mr. Grizzly bear went to sleep.  And he slept.  And he slept.  And he slept and slept and slept.  Days passed and he slept.  Weeks passed and he slept.  Mr. Grizzly Bear slept for months.  When he finally woke up
he went outside and the sun was shining, the air was warm, the grass was green, the river was flowing, and there was plenty to eat.  As Mr. Grizzly bear yawned and cleared his head he remembered how little Miss Mouse
said he couldn't just sleep until all his problems went away.  But he totally could and it was awesome.
<br/><br/>
THE END
